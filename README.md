# Turing Machine Emulator (Qt C++)

This is a fully functional **Turing machine emulator** written in **C++ with Qt**, offering a visual and interactive environment to simulate the behavior of abstract Turing machines.

The emulator allows you to configure the **tape**, **alphabet**, and **transition table**, and then run or step through execution with smooth **animation of the tape head**.
